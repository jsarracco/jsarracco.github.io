## Quick and painless site development and it's free

I spent some time this weekend creating this simple web site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I have to say, it was a lot better than my experience using Wordpress. I was always frustrated about how bloated Wordpress was, PHP syntax was pretty ugly and I feel much more in control of the final result.

More to come.
